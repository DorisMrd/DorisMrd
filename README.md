- 👋🏾 Hi, I’m @DorisMrd
- 👀 I’m interested in collaborating with others, breaking some codes and learning more about how 
to build projects that help me to solve everyday problems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL and Python for Data Analysis, Data wrangling with pandas, numpy and ipython,
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me get more hands on experience in either or just to 
watch and learn. As this hobby is a bit intimitating when you are just starting out! 
- 📫 How to reach me you'll find me peeking around other projects and rrepositories. Feel free to ping me here 
or leave me a comment!

Can't wait to connect and collaborate with all of you cool peeps!
